# Image server for TRMNL built with Node.js and JSX



## Technologies used:
- [Satori](https://www.npmjs.com/package/satori) for rendering JSX to SVG
- [resvg-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@resvg/resvg-js) for rendering SVG to PNG
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as API server

## Prerequisites
To run your TRMNL server you need any form of server (VM, droplet, pod, instance) somewhere, for example AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean.

## Quick Start
1. Press button `Use this template` on Github or clone this repository
2. Example of JSX code already in repo and you can change it
3. Create file .env.local based on .env.example 
3. You can preview result locally `npm run watch`
5. After changes you should deploy your version of this repo to your server

## Design limitations
Satori uses the same Flexbox layout engine as React Native, and itâ€™s not a complete CSS implementation.<br>
However, it supports a subset of the spec that covers most common [CSS features](https://github.com/vercel/satori?tab=readme-ov-file#css)
