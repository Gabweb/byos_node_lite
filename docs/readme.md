# Image server for TRMNL built with Node.js, JSX and CSS

You can build a custom screen for [Redirect](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/11035846-redirect-plugin)
or [Alias](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/10701448-alias-plugin) plugins with your data and design.

As it bult on popular Javascript and Node.js platform, you can easily connect to database, fetch requests or get data
from any source, and design it with HTML, JSX, CSS.

## Quick Start

1. Press button `Use this template` on Github or clone this repository
2. Example of JSX code already in repo and you can change it
3. Create file .env.local based on .env.example
3. You can preview result locally `npm run watch`
5. After changes you should deploy your version of this repo to your server

## Technologies used:

- [Satori](https://www.npmjs.com/package/satori) for rendering JSX to SVG
- [resvg-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@resvg/resvg-js) for rendering SVG to PNG
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as API server
- [TSX](https://tsx.is) for supporting JSX/TSX files

## Endpoints of server

**Image** http://localhost:3000/image?secret_key=... <br>
-- can be used for preview and [Alias](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/10701448-alias-plugin) plugin

**API** http://localhost:3000/plugin/redirect?secret_key=... <br>
-- can be used for [Redirect](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/11035846-redirect-plugin) plugin

## JSX components

You can use regular JSX components (similar to React), but without hooks, as screen is rendering only once.<br>
Starting point is [App.tsx](../src/Template/App.tsx) <br>
It's easier to collect all variables and data [in one place](../src/Data/PrepareData.ts), before components. But you can
change to any structure that you prefer.

## Layout design limitations
- Satori supports **CSS Flexbox** layout engine only
- [itâ€™s not a complete CSS standards implementation](https://github.com/vercel/satori?tab=readme-ov-file#css) 
- Each element (like `<div>`) with a few child nodes should have explicit "display: flex"

## Using fonts

To render screen you have to [provide a font file](../src/Utils/JSXtoPNG.ts). One is [attached by default](../assets/fonts/).

## Including images

You can include local images by using [LocalImage](../src/Template/LocalImage.tsx) component or specify public url to
somewhere.

## Your Server (Production)

To run your TRMNL server you need any form of server (VM, droplet, pod, instance) somewhere, for example AWS, Google
Cloud, Digital Ocean.

- it can be run via [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) or command `npm run start`
- Better to pass ENV parameters from secure storage that your cloud provider has

## Troubleshooting

Check log of errors on device:

```
https://usetrmnl.com/dashboard > top right dropdown > gear icon > scroll down to "Logs"
```

Fetch Screen Content as your device (Developer edition):

```
curl https://usetrmnl.com/api/display --header "access-token:xxxxxx"
```

## Bring your own server (BYOS)
This repo implements [basic BYOS server](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byos) for one device.<br>
You can setup it with those steps:
1. Put your device's MAC value to ENV (can be .env.local). If you don't know it: just put anything and check server logs.
2. Hold round button on your device for more than5 seconds - you should see connection instructions on screen.
3. Connect your phone to wifi called `TRMNL`
4. On setup choose `use your own server`
5. Check logs of server
6. If it still `wrong access-token value from device` - you may need to choose `Soft reset` on setup stage
